# I am a dog. 

Before you think I'm crazy — like most people do — let me elaborate on this seemingly ridiculous statement. 

When I was a child, I was fascinated by Scooby-Doo because I love dogs. My sister started calling me "puppy"; it was her way of showing affection and appreciation for what was important to me. Before we even realized it, my whole family became a pack of dogs, with a puppy (me), a doggy (my sister), a fat dog (my brother), and the Alpha dog (my mom). It became our thing, and we were not afraid of showing it around other people, who often would give us a weird look.

It might be a silly story, but it illustrates one of the main things that helped shape the person I am today. I could mention all the times I have been called "weird" because of the way I have fun and express myself as I truly am. It could have affected me if I was not lucky enough to have such a supportive family who taught me to embrace myself, not let the weird looks take away my uniqueness, know that it is okay to be weird and a little bit crazy as long as I enjoy my life, and to celebrate diversity.

In my journey towards self-acceptance, I have come to recognize the incredible strength that lies in embracing one's passions and quirks, free from the constraints of societal expectations and judgments. With the unwavering support and love of my family, I have gained the confidence to express myself authentically, celebrating the very aspects that make me unique.

Now that I am not a puppy but a grown-up dog, I have made it my mission to share this empowering mindset with my loved ones. I strive to help them shed any hidden insecurities and embrace their own peculiarities. We all deserve to live authentically, unleashing the joy and fulfillment that comes with embracing our true selves. So, let us be a pack of dogs, proudly wagging our tails and embracing the vibrant diversity that makes each of us wonderfully weird and beautifully unique.
